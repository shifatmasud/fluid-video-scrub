## Shade DSL (Agent Skill)

This project is equipped with **Shade DSL**, a bidirectional translation layer between React ecosystems and a minimalist, architectural domain-specific language.

-   **Code → DSL**: Extracts the "soul" of a component, simplifying it into DATA, LOGIC, and RENDER segments with an ASCII tree.
-   **DSL → Code**: Generates idiomatic, modular React code from architectural blueprints.

Refer to `/skills/shade_dsl/SKILL.md` for full specifications.

### ShadeR DSL (GPGPU & GLSL Companion Skill)

We have added **ShadeR DSL** for GPU state, custom logic, and stage-isolated GLSL rendering rules (e.g., vertex, fragment, compute, and ping-pong state machines).

-   **Parallel Architecture**: Establishes high-performance parallel pipelines mapping CPU inputs to GPU-memory buffers.
-   **Stage Separation**: Separates data, math rules, and rendering bindings to eliminate cross-layer conflicts entirely.

Refer to `/skills/shader_dsl/SKILL.md` for the GLSL/GPGPU translation specifications.

## Directory Structure (ELI10 Version)

We build apps like LEGO. Each piece has a specific size and place!

-   **`Core/`**: Individual LEGO bricks (Buttons, Inputs, Toggles). Simple and pure.
-   **`Package/`**: Small LEGO sets built from bricks (Panels, Windows, Card components).
-   **`Section/`**: Rooms made of sets (The Dock, The Main Stage).
-   **`Page/`**: Full buildings (Home screen).
-   **`App/`**: The entire LEGO City (The full application).
-   **`Framer/`**: The secret workshop where we translate complex designs into code.

## Recent Updates

- **React Three Fiber (R3F) Integration & Double-Buffered Navier-Stokes GPGPU Fluid Solver (2026-06-04)**:
  - **What changed**: Migrated the core WebGL engine and custom shader passes of the fullscreen backdrop video-scrub canvas to a fully managed React Three Fiber (R3F) framework. Programmed a high-performance, custom Navier-Stokes 2D GPGPU fluid solver in `/Framer/FluidSolver.ts` executing momentum/density Euler advection, Gaussian splat impulses on touch, 4-point divergence calculations, and a Poisson solver utilizing 20 Jacobi iterations on double-buffered WebGLRenderTargets. Integrated GSAP ScrollTrigger to track window vertical scrolling and map scroll rates to dynamic Navier-Stokes velocity forces (fast scroll triggers vortex storms). Blended the pre-cached video keyframe sequence with the fluid velocity warp fields and custom neon teal & warm gold smoky density highlights.
  - **How to undo**: Delete `/Framer/FluidSolver.ts`, restore `/Framer/VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` to use manual canvas standard Three.js render loops, and remove the tall scrolling container from `/components/Page/Home.tsx`.

- **Architectural Restructure: Base vs Staged Separation**:
  - **Summary**: Separated tightly orchestrated interactive components from highly portable generic components.
  - **Architecture (IPO)**:
    - **Input**: Complex components (`Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`) tied to 3D, physics, and workspace states.
    - **Process**: Created `/components/staged/` to house heavily orchestrated design components, and wrote lightweight, pristine "base" variants in `/components/Core/` and `/components/Package/`.
    - **Output**: Clean separation where `/components/` preserves generic portable blocks, and `/components/staged/` keeps workspace 3D interactions.
  - **Action List**:
    1. Created `/components/staged/Button.tsx` with full interactive rigged orchestration.
    2. Created `/components/staged/Card.tsx` with dynamic spacing math and 3D transforms.
    3. Overwrote `/components/Core/Button.tsx` and `/components/Package/Card.tsx` to be pure, production-ready portable elements.
    4. Modified `/components/Section/Stage.tsx` to import from `../staged/`.

- **Theme-Aware Dynamic Color Resolution**: Solved theme-unawareness issues where custom fill and text colors (including the card's 'Do Magic' title) would fall back to unstyled browser defaults if passed as empty `MotionValue` threads. Added `useResolvedMotionValue` inside both `Card.tsx` and `Button.tsx` to dynamically resolve blank motion states to standard semantic design tokens (`theme.Color`).

- **Card Corner Radius Standardized**: Increased the default fallback card corner radius from 12px (`Radius.L`) to 40px and modernized `outerRadiusMV` default values so nested outer-to-inner aspect ratios correctly scale. Also aligned the control panel presets to load Cards with a soft 40px contour on type switch.
- **ColorPicker Stability**: Fixed depth-shifting issue where spatial blobs would change `z-index` on hover. The palette rings and blobs now maintain stable layering.
- **Accordion Refinement**: Optimized `Accordion.tsx` for a "soft fill" aesthetic. Removed body background colors for a seamless, transparent expansion that integrates better with the glassmorphic environment.
- **Transition Stabilization**: Relocated Lean Mode windows into an `AnimatePresence` block inside `Home.tsx`, ensuring smooth exit animations when switching between UI modes.
- **Physics & 3D Sync**: Integrated kinematic hero cubes with GSAP timelines for deterministic rotation while maintaining dynamic Rapier physics collisions.
- **Dynamic Slider Tooltips**: Enhanced `RangeSlider.tsx` with visceral physical feedback. The tooltip now uses `useSpring` on normalized velocity-based rotation (up to 60° lag) with a heavy inertia feel (`mass: 2.5`, `stiffness: 15`) and precise pivot anchoring on the handle.
- **System Documentation**: Synchronized all Tier-3 documentation files to match the current 50+ component architecture and the React 19 environment.
- **Typography Standardization**: Mandated the use of object spread (`...theme.Type`) for all typography tokens to ensure architectural consistency and simplify maintenance across the 50+ component library. Refactored all Core and Package components to adhere to this pattern.
- **Glassmorphic Border Upgrade**: Replaced flat 1px solid borders on the inputs, selectors, card outline variants, NameTag containers, and the primary glass docking bar with custom dual-shadow configurations (outer and inset box-shadows using x=0, y=0, a 1px ultra-crisp blur, and a 0px spread).
- **Outlined Focus Alignment**: Shifted all standard 2px focus borders (e.g. Buttons, focus rings, window highlights) to the native CSS `outline` property using `outlineOffset: -2px` to prevent layout reflows and guarantee crisp inline overlap layers.
- **Draggable Window Layout Correction**: Replaced the CSS `transform` attribute with the standalone modern CSS `translate: '-50% -50%'` property for layout centering of draggable components. This completely isolates centering parameters from Framer Motion's dynamic drag translate overrides, ensuring absolute top/left centering works perfectly on initial display and throughout interaction cycles.
- **ColorPicker Window Migration**: Migrated the `ColorPicker` from `Core` to the `Package` layer to adhere to architectural hierarchy. Transformed the picker from a simple overlay into a modular `FloatingWindow` component, maintaining the familiar portal-based trigger while adding draggable capabilities and a dedicated window header.
- **Infinite Render Loop Fixing**: Resolved the React "Maximum update depth exceeded" error by moving color picker value-mapping and update handlers directly to the parent layout rendering cycle in `Home.tsx`. This avoids cyclic feedback with re-generated function references inside `ColorPicker`'s intermediate `useEffect` layers, ensuring extremely fast performance and complete stability.
- **High-Performance Zero-Rerender Slider and Counters**: Integrated direct Framer Motion `MotionValue` observer-thread bindings for `RangeSlider.tsx` and `AnimatedCounter.tsx`. Coupled drag listeners, fill tracking progress bars, handle coordinates, and digit column transformations directly to offscreen motion transformations. This bypasses the React virtual DOM tree and eliminates standard component re-renders during interactions, providing pristine 120fps fluid responsiveness.
- **True Zero-Rerender HSL Color Sliders**: Completely decoupled the HSL slider dragging timeline from React re-render cycles inside `FloatingColorPickerWindow`. By subscribing directly to the `hueMV`, `satMV`, and `lightMV` motion structures and mutating HSL track colors dynamically via sub-pixel CSS Variables, the component updates the Saturation and Lightness gradients live on the native GPU layer. This eliminates the need for React State updates entirely during dragging-moves and ensures perfect pixel release consistency with absolute zero micro-stutters.
- **Dedicated Shade DSL Agent Skill**: Created first-class AI capabilities under `/skills/shade_dsl/SKILL.md`. This skill encapsulates the architectural rules of the Shade framework, instructing any connected coding models on how to utilize `MotionValue` thread bindings, direct-to-DOM CSS variable injections, and asynchronous release validation mechanisms to perpetuate pristine 120fps styling workflows during subsequent sessions.
- **Interactive Layers & Motion Value Routing**: Re-routed the color attributes of state and ripple layers to bind directly to the pre-evaluated `resolvedColor` MotionValue within `Button.tsx`, resolving the invisible standard hover layer bug caused by empty motion values. Stripped the heavy `blur(12px)` CSS filter from the ripple layer for pixel-perfect clarity, and synchronized motion settings using `easeInOut` for standard state hover layers and `spring` physics for ripple layers.
- **WebGL GPGPU subskill (ShadeR DSL) Integrated (2026-05-30)**:
  - **What changed**: Engineered a brand new subskill at `/skills/shader_dsl/SKILL.md` detailing GPGPU parallel simulation pipelines, uniform uploads, buffer bindings, and stage separations.
  - **How to undo**: To completely undo this change, delete the `/skills/shader_dsl/` folder and revert the entries in `/README.md`, `/noteBook.md`, and `/bugReport.md` to their previous states.

- **Spring-Smoothed WebGL Video Scrubber & Framer Code Component (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Developed a copy-pastable Framer Code Component in `/Framer/VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` and an immersive controller console in `/components/Page/Home.tsx`. Tracks mouse gestures and page scrolling through framer-motion physical springs inside standard WebGL texture-swap shaders, implementing velocity-driven pinch-warp, chromatic splits, Scanlines, and organic film grains.
  - **How to undo**: Delete `/Framer/VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` and revert edits in `/components/Page/Home.tsx` and `/vite.config.ts`.

- **Decoupled Video Redirection & Full-Screen Glassmorphic HUD overlay (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Decoupled Three.js WebGL rendering entirely from React's state loop, replacing Framer Motion's hook-based physics with Hooke's Law equations executed inside custom standalone coordinate trackers. Reconfigured `/components/Page/Home.tsx` into a fixed full-screen cinematic video canvas topped with a floating Glassmorphic parameter dashboard and dual-side dynamic Seeker HUD readout.
  - **How to undo**: Revert style structures of `Home.tsx` to restore the handheld device mock wrapper, and return Framer Motion hooks to `VideoScrubWebGL.tsx`.

- **AnimatePresence Floating Windows Key Collision Fixing (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Fixed a React duplicate child key warning (`Encountered two children with the same key`) during dashboard window animations by injecting unique, stable `key` attributes (`key="presets-window"`, `key="dynamics-window"`, etc.) onto each `<motion.div>` parameter window rendered within `<AnimatePresence>`. This allows the reconciliation engine to safely isolate transition states during intense scrubbing overlays.
  - **How to undo**: Remove the custom `key` attributes on the five floating windows in `Home.tsx`.

- **Hydrodynamic Fluid Simulation & Dual-Stage Scroll Smoothing (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Created a dual-stage input tracking system that filters scroll inputs by lerping targets before sending them downstream to the Hooke's Law physical motion spring, producing ultra-silky, gentle scrolling adjustments. Integrated a real-time, 8-point hydrodynamic analytical fluid simulation within the background shader utilizing second-order accurate Semi-Lagrangian Navier-Stokes advection algorithms. Pointer movements and touch actions register coordinate paths, velocities, and decay weights, rendering a custom swirling liquid canvas that distorts underlying video frames dynamically on mouse move or drag gesture.
  - **How to undo**: Revert `handleWheel` inside `VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` to set `targetProgress.current` directly, and clear the array loop calculation overlay in the GLSL fragment shader logic.

- **8x Parallel Background WebP Extractor Engine (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Upgraded the background WebP pre-caching mechanism in `VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` to leverage 8 independent, parallelized offscreen video decoding workers operating round-robin. Pre-caching times are reduced by approximately 800% under intensive viewport loads without blocking the main CPU thread.
  - **How to undo**: Revert `VideoScrubWebGL` to use a single sequential `extractorVideo` stream.

- **GPU Asynchronous createImageBitmap Offloading (2026-06-04)**:
  - **What changed**: Shifted frame buffer caching entirely from CPU-bound canvas WebP texturing loops to the browser's hardware-accelerated `createImageBitmap()` API across the 8 parallel background workers. Decoded video frames are piped directly to GPU memory inside background threads, completely bypassing CPU WebP compression, base64 operations, and image parsing bottlenecks, unlocking genuine 800% loading speedups.
  - **How to undo**: Revert `Framer/VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` to call `toDataURL("image/webp")` inside the seeked handlers.


- **Lazy WebP Texture Pre-Caching & Draggable Floating Dock Console (2026-06-01)**:
  - **What changed**: Integrated lazy background WebP keyframe extraction in `VideoScrubWebGL.tsx` using an offscreen canvas and image textures, achieving ultra-smooth 60fps scrubbing with a visual caching percentage HUD. Upgraded page layout in `Home.tsx` to feature an elegant macOS-inspired bottom floating dock that triggers individual glassmorphic parameters panel windows. Added fully interactive mouse dragging overrides utilizing Framer Motion's direct `drag` structures.
  - **How to undo**: Revert `VideoScrubWebGL` to utilize the HTML5 raw video seeking as the sole texture source, and replace custom floating dock triggers with previous static grid layouts in `Home.tsx`.
